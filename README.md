## ðŸ™Œ Introduction
The goal of good health and well-being is challenged in impoverished countries due to a lack of diverse medical services, resulting in people leading unhealthy lives. Missed check-up appointments can lead to diseases and even fatalities. While efforts are underway in the medical field, progress is slow. In such circumstances, individuals can ensure better health check-ups even over extended periods by monitoring their own health status and maintaining a daily record of hard-to-remember conditions.

In some regions, girls are denied access to healthcare or adequate nutrition, contributing to a higher mortality rate. To address such issues, we have developed a service specifically tailored for women to manage their health effectively.

The 10th Sustainable Development Goal, Reduced Inequalities, highlights the plight of women who lack access to healthcare and face increased risks during childbirth. Through self-diagnosis and monitoring their physical condition before childbirth, women can effectively manage their health. Moreover, to assist users who may have limitations in reading or writing, we have incorporated features to convert speech to text and text to speech.
